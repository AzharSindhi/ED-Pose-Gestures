calculate f1 score for gesture classes only
understand how the labels are processed and loss is calculated (matching loss between gt and 100 preds)
update the architecture adding the gesture specific classifier using gesture specific queries (initialized as the proposal confidences)
what will be the loss function (how GT and pred will be mapped)
