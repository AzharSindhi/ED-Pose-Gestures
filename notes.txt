vanilla works better than deformable
vanilla and orig edpose with coco pretrained weights same results
better results with finetuning with gesture one class weights
deformable finetuned on edpose weights slightly better than original

does the improvement in scores occurs because of increase in the capacity? to evalualte this, increase the number of human keypoint and box decoder layers
and check the scores with original
